Enhance the existing Life of Faith Church Management App with the following additional features and improvements (do not rebuild from scratch).

🧭 1. Departmental Sorting & Smart Search

Add sorting and filtering options for the attendance and member list by:

Date

Department

Gender

Alphabetical order (A–Z / Z–A)

Add a search bar for real-time lookup by name, phone number, or department.

Include both List View and Grid View options for member and attendance display.

✅ 2. Attendance Auto-Integration with SMS Page

When attendance is marked, automatically pass the present and absent data to the “Send SMS” page.

The SMS page should auto-select the right recipients:

Those present for “Thanks for joining us today”

Those absent for “We missed you in service today”

This eliminates the need for manual checkbox selection.

👑 3. Department Leadership Access Structure

Department leaders should:

Only see and manage their department’s members and reports.

Be able to log attendance and view birthdays of their members.

Not access API, balance, or system settings.

Pastors, Admins, and Secretaries can:

View and manage all departments and members.

See each department’s leader name and their attendance report submission.

View reports filtered by department or leader.

Have full oversight across the entire church structure.

🗓️ 4. Automatic Birthday SMS System

The app should automatically send birthday SMS messages daily at 6 AM.

Birthdays stored as MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DD.

If year is missing, it still works fine.

Use default birthday message:

Happy Birthday {{name}}!
May this new year overflow with joy and grace.
– Life of Faith Church 💛

Admins, Secretaries, and Pastors can:

Edit templates

View upcoming birthdays

Pause or modify automatic sending

Department leaders can only view birthdays of their department members.

💬 5. SMS Delivery Report Fix

The SMS delivery reporting system should match the real NigeriaBulkSMS portal status.

When sending messages:

Save each message_id from NigeriaBulkSMS.

Query delivery status periodically via:

https://portal.nigeriabulksms.com/api/report/?username=...&password=...&message_id=...


Update each message log with:

Delivered ✅

Failed ❌

Pending ⏳

Ensure the in-app report no longer marks Delivered messages as Failed when they are actually delivered.

💰 6. NigeriaBulkSMS Balance Fetch Integration

Automatically fetch SMS credit balance from:

https://portal.nigeriabulksms.com/api/?username=EMAIL&password=PASSWORD&balance=true


Sync every 6–12 hours, or when admin dashboard loads.

Display in dashboard for Admins, Secretaries, and Pastors only:

SMS Balance: 1,250.50 Units (Healthy)
Last Updated: 06 Oct 2025 | 7:00 AM


Add a Refresh Balance button for manual update.

Trigger low-balance alerts:

🟡 Below 1000 units: “Low balance warning”

🔴 Below 200 units: send alert SMS/email to Admins & Secretaries

🧑‍💼 7. Departmental Leadership Visibility

In the Admin/Secretary dashboard, show:

Each Department Name

The Department Leader

Their most recent attendance report summary

Status badges (e.g., ✅ Submitted, ⚠️ Pending)

Example:

[Music Dept] | Leader: Joy Okoro | Last Report: Oct 6 | Status: ✅ Submitted
[Ushering Dept] | Leader: Bright Samuel | Last Report: Oct 5 | Status: ⚠️ Pending
